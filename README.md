# OpenGL Evolution

## Contributors
- Christopher Rice

## Description
This is the main branch of my OpenGL Evolution projects. The main point of this project is to show off my evolution as a programmer as I learn OpenGl. Each branch will be its own project starting with branch one, a program that renders a simple triangle, with each successive branch showcasing a more advance graphical technique or technical feature.
